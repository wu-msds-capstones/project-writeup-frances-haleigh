## Goal 1: Predicting Chronic Conditions Based On Insurance Type
To answer the question of how state insurance in particular impacts one’s health status, we evaluated two common chronic conditions in the United States, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  

### Diabetes
#### Public Insurance
We immediately plotted our mean diabetes percentages by Medicaid percentage across states to see if any obvious correlation existed (see <a href="./Figures/dm_medicaid.png" title="Figure 5A">Figure 5A</a>). No correlation was obvious, but there appeared to be a slight linear trend. We created a logisitic regression model predicting quartile of diabetes prevalence by many Medicaid-related covariates, such as how many adults did not see a doctor in the past twelve months due to cost, state Medicaid expenditure, state Medicaid spending, total Medicaid spending, and population percentage on Medicaid. Our simple model showed a surprising 54% accuracy in predicting how many people in a given population would have diabetes based on these factors. We had a small dataset, however, so cross validation showed our accuracy to be 38% with a standard deviation of 20%. While Medicaid-related factors may not be able to completely predict diabetes prevalence, it certainly is correlated. 

![Figure 5A: There may be a slight linear correlation between mean diabetes percentage per state and Medicaid percentage, so we will see how a regression can predict diabetes prevalence.](./Figures/dm_medicaid.png)

#### Private Insurance
In contrast, the same plot with private insurance percentages shows a negative trend (see <a href="./Figures/dm_private_ins.png" title="Figure 5B">Figure 5B</a>).

![Figure 5B: Opposite of the public insurance data, there may be a slight *negative* linear correlation between mean diabetes percentage per state and private insurance percentage. Again, we will confirm this with regression.](./Figures/dm_private_ins.png)

We made another logisitic regression model with just diabetes prevalance and percent private insurance per state with only 23% accuracy. Though this is lower than the above-mentioned public insurance data, it is important to note that we are using only *one* predictor in this model- percent of privately insured individuals. In the above model, we used all Medicaid-related variables (thirteen total predictors). Again, this shows that a correlation exists between the type of insurance and diabetes prevalence. 

### Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)
#### Public Insurance
As with our diabetes dataset, we again repeated the above process to predict CVD prevalence based on Medicaid-only related factors. Our simple scatterplot shows a faint linear trend. Our model accurately predicted CVD prevalence only 15% of the time- though this can possibly be explained by our small dataset. Cross validation testing revealed an accuracy of 41% with a standard deviation of 25%. Though not as obvious as with our diabetes data, there may be some correlation between only Medicaid-related factors and cardiovascular disease. 

![Figure 5C: As with the diabetes data, there again appears to be a slight linear correlation between mean CVD percentage per state and Medicaid percentage.](./Figures/cvd_medicaid.png)

#### Private Insurance
Turning once again to our privately insured individuals, a similar model accurately prediced CVD prevalence only 15% of the time. The same problems as before apply; our dataset had few data points to truly train, and we are again only using one predictor (percent of private insurance per state) rather than thirteen from our public insurance models. The fact that our one predictor can produce an accuracy equal to the publicly insured model suggests that there may be some correlation between insurance type and chronic disease prevalence.

![Figure 5D: Again, there appears to be a slight *negative* linear correlation between mean CVD percentage per state and private insurance percentage. We will confirm this with regression.](./Figures/cvd_private_ins.png)

## Goal 2: Detecting differences in access to care by insurance type
FILL IN

## Goal 3: Analyzing Impact of Access to Care on Health Metrics
In order to evaluate the health status of a group of people, we turned to three common metrics for doing so: life expectancy, mortality, and infant mortality.³ In the following sections, we modeled each of these by a list of variables representing access to care (see [@sec-s_table_2]). Our goal was to determine how access to care influenced each of these three metrics for determining health of a population.

### Life Expectancy

![Fig 2A: Median life expectancy of most states is between 77 and 80 years old.](./images/life_expectancy_by_state.png)

Figure 2A demonstrates how median life expectancy varies by state. We decided to keep state in our linear model because it did have a significant correlation with life expectancy. Since not all of the states were significantly correlated, we created the following plot to show which states were significantly correlated (positively or negatively) with life expectancy, as is seen in Figure 2B. 

![Figure 2B: There does not appear to be a geographic influence on median life expectancy.](./images/life_expectancy_significanct_state.png)

Figure 2C shows our final linear model and coefficient table for preventative healthcare measures and life expectancy. We found that Primary Care Physician (PCP) Ratio were both positively correlated with life expectancy. Percentage of Food Insecurity and Segregation Index were both negatively correlated with life expectancy (that is, as food insecurity increased, life expectancy decreased). Percentage of Access to Broadband Internet was also positively correlated with life expectancy.

To better understand the survival (life expectancy) of different groups for each of these variables, we created Kaplan-Meier (KM) Curves where we plotted each variable by quartile. We then conducted a log rank test to compare across quantiles to see if the groups were significantly different from each other. Figure 2D shows life expectancy based on the percentage of food insecurity. Figure 2E shows the results of the log rank test (which are significant as p = <2e-16). Quantiles 1 and 2 (less food insecurity) observed less death than expected, but quantiles 3 and 4 (more food insecurity) observed more death than expected. This demonstrates that we are seeing a significant difference between life expectancy of people in the lower versus the higher quantiles of food insecurity.

![Figure 2D: As expected, those who are more food insecure have lower life expectancies.](./images/KM_food.png)

|------------|-----|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| quantile=1 | 704 | 704      | 505      | 78.411    | 98.013    |

| quantile=4 | 749 | 749      | 1135     | 131.551   | 230.098   |

Kaplan-Meier Curves for life expectancy were made with the following variables: PCP Ratio, Percentage of Food Insecurity, Segregation Index, and Percentage of Broadband Internet Access. Log rank tests were performed, and all of the results were significant. To explore the curves and log rank test results, please explore our gallery below:

We then used machine learning algorithms to predict life expectancy of individuals based on these significant covariates along with the top ten features found through KBest (see <a href="./Figures/kbest_life_exp.png" title="Figure S.1A">Supplemental Figure 1A</a>). It is important to note that a lot of features were found in both the linear regression model explained above and in the KBest result. 

Our model predicted life expectancy based only on the fifteen significant access-to-care-related variables with 56% accuracy. While this may at first appear unimpressive, it’s important to note that 56% of life expectancy can be predicted or explained by only fifteen items- all of which relate to one’s access to healthcare. Only the remaining 44% can be explained by all other factors in a person’s life. 

### Infant Mortality
![Figure 3A: Most states see an infant mortaliy rate of 6 deaths per 1,000 live births.](./images/median_infant_mortality_by_state.png)

Figure 3A shows a difference between median infant mortality rates between states. Note that the chart appears to “stair-step” as infant mortality rates are represented as integers rather than continuous numbers. Because of the linear trend associated with each state, we included the variable in our linear model to determine which states were significantly correlated with infant mortality. 

![Figure 3B: Many of the same states that have longer life expectancies (Fig. 2B) as have lower infant mortality rates. Only Mississippi and Maryland have infant mortality rates significantly greater than the rest.](./images/significance_state_infant_mortality.png)

Figure 3B shows which states were positively or negatively correlated with infant mortality. Note that this time, negative significance in plotted in green as it indicates a lower infant mortality rate. In this case, Maryland and Mississippi are the only states with significantly higher rates of infant mortality.

In terms of preventative healthcare measures that were significantly correlated with infant mortality (Figure 3C), we found that Median Household Income and Broadband Internet Access were significantly correlated in the negative direction with infant mortality rates. That is, as income and access to the Internet increased, infant mortality rates decreased. We came across the same issue with segregation here as we did in our life expectancy model. The Segregation Index coefficient shows that as segregation increases, infant mortality rates increase as well.

lm(formula = `INFANT_MORTALITY_RATE` ~ `state_name` + `AVERAGE_DAILY_PM2.5` +

    data = ds_mortality_adjusted)
```
| Predictor                        | Estimate  | Std. Error | t value | Pr(>\|t\|)    |

| (Intercept)                      | 57.531253 | 2.427216   | 23.703  | < 2e-16 *** |

In our machine learning model, we repeated the same process for infant mortality rate as for life expectancy, but got a low accuracy score of 36% due to the high number of NAs in our Infant Mortality Rate column. Future analyses would do well to increase record-keeping of infant mortality rates by county as the metric “indicates the current health status of a population and reflects the overall state of maternal health, as well as the quality and accessibility of primary health care available to pregnant women and infants.”³

### Age Adjusted Death Rate
![Figure 4A: Most states have a median ade-adjusted mortality rate of 300-400 deaths per 100,000 people. Mississippi has both the highest median age-adjusted mortality and infant mortality rates (Fig. 3A).](./images/median_mortality_rate_by_state.png)

Age-adjusted death rate (mortality rate) appeared to vary across states as seen in Figure 4A, so we again kept state in our linear model. Figure 4B shows which states were significantly correlated with mortality rate. Negative correlation is in green to represent significantly lower death rates. The opposite is true for red-colored states.

![Figure 4B: Most states do not have an age-adjusted mortality rate different from the rest. All states with a lower mortality rate also have higher life expectancies (the same is not true for higher mortality rates and lower life expectancies).](./images/significance_state_death_rate_map.png)

Preventative healthcare measures that were significantly correlated with mortality rate are shown in Figure 4C. As food insecurity, segregation, and school segregation increased, mortality rates increased as well. As broadband internet access, vaccination, and number of rural residents increased, mortality rates decreased.

Looking at demographics, we noticed as income increased among white Americans, mortality rates decreased. This income trend was the opposite among Asian and Hispanic Americans. Looking closer at the income correlation plots, the trends for Asian and Hispanic Americans appear to have more data points that could be considered outliers. As the percentage of severe housing issues increased, the mortality rate decreased, but the correlation plot appears to have outliers that could be skewing this trend as well.

Finally, we repeated our machine learning process to predict age-adjusted death rate based on our significant access to care covariates. Our model accurately predicted the binned death rate for 62% of our test data. Just thirteen access-to-care-related covariates predicted mortality rate 62% of the time! This again emphasizes the importance of access to care in one’s overall health status.  

## Goal 4: Creating an Overall Health Quality Variable
As a final metric for assessing quality of health, we wanted to create a new variable that represented the overall health of a population. We knew that the following variables should be included in the creation of this new variable: Life Expectancy, Age-Adjusted Death Rate, Years of Potential Life Lost Rate, Percent of Frequent Physical Distress Days, and Percent of Frequent Mental Distress Days. We chose the first three for the same reasons explained in the introduction to our results.3 Note that we left out Infant Mortality Rate due to its high number of NAs, as explained above. We added the final two metrics to account for a person’s perceived quality of life, which does influence’s one's actual health quality. A clear linear relationship is seen between each of these metrics in the pair plot below (Fig 6A).

![Figure 6A: We chose these five variables to summarize our overall health metric since they are all linearly correlated with each other.](./Figures/pairplot.png)

Though the first eigenvalue of our entire dataset only explained 31% of the variance in our dataset, we continued by projecting the variables above to this first eigenvalue, thus “creating” a new variable that represents overall health. We then plotted the weights of all of our other variables against this new one to see how much each contributed to overall health. 87 of our original features contributed negatively to this new variable and 35 positively. Fig6B shows which features contribute the most in both a positive and negative direction to health. 

![Figure 6B: Number of alcohol associated deaths, internet access, education level, number of dentists, and uninsured status are all variables that contribute most heavily to our overall health metric.](./Figures/weights.png)
