    "section": "3.1 Data Ingestion",
    "text": "3.1 Data Ingestion\nWe gathered data from two sources: KFF (an independent source for health policy research, polling, and news)⁷ and County Health Rankings and Roadmaps (CHRR).² Though we collected data across several years, we analyzed only data from 2022 due to data quality concerns when comparing year to year.\n\n3.1.1 KFF: Collection and Cleaning\nWe generated a custom report from data available on KFF, downloading a large variety of data from 2017-2022 (not including 2020 due to lack of data collection) for each state in the U.S. Variables we investigated from this dataset included percentage of population on Medicare, percentage of adults who smoke, healthcare expenditure, median annual household income, cervical cancer incidence rate, and many more potentially relevant factors.⁷\nKFF data for each state was downloaded as CSVs. We chose the most recent dates for all of the different health and insurance related questions between 2017-2022. The CSVs originally had a question, state, and value field. We used text parsing to create a column called demographic and a column called group. This allowed us to parse out demographics like age, race/ethnicity, poverty level and create groups within each of those.\nWe also created fields called year and measure, and parsed out the years and measurements from the question field. Some questions had multiple demographics, so we created a secondary_demographic field and a secondary_group field. These are not ranked.\nFinally, we added a county column (which we filled with all NA) and edited the state and question fields to replicate the way that data from our CHFF dataset was formatted. This allowed us to merge the two datasets.\n\n\n3.1.2 CHRR: Collection and Cleaning\nSimilar to KFF, we downloaded data for each state from 2017-2022 (not including 2020 due to lack of data collection) from County Health Rankings and Roadmaps (CHRR). We chose the “20xx County Health Release National Data” links for each year. Data from CHRR originally came in two separate CSVs for each year and broke up the data by each county in the United States. This data included metrics such as life_expectancy, age-adjusted_death_rate, years_of_potential_life_loss_rate, food_environment_index, percentage_of_physically_inactive_adults, percentage_of_excessive_drinking, Primary_Care_Provider_ratio, and much more.²\nFirst, we cleaned up the columns. We reviewed the documentation and renamed any potentially confusing column names. For example, #_Medicaid_Enrollees became no_female_medicaid_enrollees to avoid mistakenly believing the first column included both genders in its count. We dropped columns that would not be of help to us, such as columns containing the word Unreliable. We replaced all spaces with an underscore.\nSecond, we joined the two CSVs for each year to have one CSV per year and added a Year column to help with merging later.\nFinally, we reformatted the CSVs to match that of the KFF data, where our original columns became the question column and the values filled in a new values column. Again, we used text parsing such as grepl and gsub to fill in our newly created demographic, measure, group, secondary_demographic, and secondary_group, columns. For example, if our question was mean_%_Children_in_Poverty_(white), our demographic, group, secondary_demographic, and secondary_group columns became “Race/Ethnicity”, “White”, “Age”, and “0-17”, respectively.\nSince the questions and potential answers collected by CHRR data varied each year, we made sure that our cleaning code was modified for each year to both accommodate the changes in the data and match identical answers from previous years. As an example, the only races that were listed as options in the 2017 data were “White”, “Black”, “Hispanic”, and “Asian”. However, by the 2022 data collection, the options had expanded to include “American Indian/Alaskan Native”, “Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander”, and “Other/Multiple Races.” In 2022, “Black” was changed to “African American,” so we changed it back to “Black” to both match the earlier CHRR data and the KFF data."

    "text": "5.1 Goal 1: Predicting Chronic Conditions Based On Insurance Type\nTo answer the question of how state insurance in particular impacts one’s health status, we evaluated two common chronic conditions in the United States, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\n5.1.1 Diabetes\n\n5.1.1.1 Public Insurance\nWe immediately plotted our mean diabetes percentages by Medicaid percentage across states to see if any obvious correlation existed (see Figure 5A). No correlation was obvious, but there appeared to be a slight linear trend. We created a logisitic regression model predicting quartile of diabetes prevalence by many Medicaid-related covariates, such as how many adults did not see a doctor in the past twelve months due to cost, state Medicaid expenditure, state Medicaid spending, total Medicaid spending, and population percentage on Medicaid. Our simple model showed a surprising 54% accuracy in predicting how many people in a given population would have diabetes based on these factors. We had a small dataset, however, so cross validation showed our accuracy to be 38% with a standard deviation of 20%. While Medicaid-related factors may not be able to completely predict diabetes prevalence, it certainly is correlated.\n\n\n\nFigure 5A: There may be a slight linear correlation between mean diabetes percentage per state and Medicaid percentage, so we will see how a regression can predict diabetes prevalence.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.1.2 Private Insurance\nIn contrast, the same plot with private insurance percentages shows a negative trend (see Figure 5B).\n\n\n\nFigure 5B: Opposite of the public insurance data, there may be a slight negative linear correlation between mean diabetes percentage per state and private insurance percentage. Again, we will confirm this with regression.\n\n\nWe made another logisitic regression model with just diabetes prevalance and percent private insurance per state with only 23% accuracy. Though this is lower than the above-mentioned public insurance data, it is important to note that we are using only one predictor in this model- percent of privately insured individuals. In the above model, we used all Medicaid-related variables (thirteen total predictors). Again, this shows that a correlation exists between the type of insurance and diabetes prevalence.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)\n\n5.1.2.1 Public Insurance\nAs with our diabetes dataset, we again repeated the above process to predict CVD prevalence based on Medicaid-only related factors. Our simple scatterplot shows a faint linear trend. Our model accurately predicted CVD prevalence only 15% of the time- though this can possibly be explained by our small dataset. Cross validation testing revealed an accuracy of 41% with a standard deviation of 25%. Though not as obvious as with our diabetes data, there may be some correlation between only Medicaid-related factors and cardiovascular disease.\n\n\n\nFigure 5C: As with the diabetes data, there again appears to be a slight linear correlation between mean CVD percentage per state and Medicaid percentage.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2.2 Private Insurance\nTurning once again to our privately insured individuals, a similar model accurately prediced CVD prevalence only 15% of the time. The same problems as before apply; our dataset had few data points to truly train, and we are again only using one predictor (percent of private insurance per state) rather than thirteen from our public insurance models. The fact that our one predictor can produce an accuracy equal to the publicly insured model suggests that there may be some correlation between insurance type and chronic disease prevalence.\n\n\n\nFigure 5D: Again, there appears to be a slight negative linear correlation between mean CVD percentage per state and private insurance percentage. We will confirm this with regression."

    "text": "5.3 Goal 3: Analyzing Impact of Access to Care on Health Metrics\nIn order to evaluate the health status of a group of people, we turned to three common metrics for doing so: life expectancy, mortality, and infant mortality.³ In the following sections, we modeled each of these by a list of variables representing access to care (see Section 8.1.2). Our goal was to determine how access to care influenced each of these three metrics for determining health of a population.\n\n5.3.1 Life Expectancy\n\n\n\nFig 2A: Median life expectancy of most states is between 77 and 80 years old.\n\n\nFigure 2A demonstrates how median life expectancy varies by state. We decided to keep state in our linear model because it did have a significant correlation with life expectancy. Since not all of the states were significantly correlated, we created the following plot to show which states were significantly correlated (positively or negatively) with life expectancy, as is seen in Figure 2B.\n\n\n\nFigure 2B: There does not appear to be a geographic influence on median life expectancy.\n\n\nFigure 2C shows our final linear model and coefficient table for preventative healthcare measures and life expectancy. We found that Primary Care Physician (PCP) Ratio were both positively correlated with life expectancy. Percentage of Food Insecurity and Segregation Index were both negatively correlated with life expectancy (that is, as food insecurity increased, life expectancy decreased). Percentage of Access to Broadband Internet was also positively correlated with life expectancy.\nFigure 2C: Life Expectancy Linear Model and Coefficient Table:\nlm(formula = `LIFE_EXPECTANCY` ~ `state_name` + `PCP_RATIO` + \n    `%_VACCINATED_(HISPANIC)` + `AVERAGE_DAILY_PM2.5` + `%_FOOD_INSECURE` + \n    `HOUSEHOLD_INCOME_(HISPANIC)_LN` +\n    `SEGREGATION_INDEX` + `%_BROADBAND_ACCESS`, data = ds_life_adjusted)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictor\nEstimate\nStd.

We then conducted a log rank test to compare across quantiles to see if the groups were significantly different from each other. Figure 2D shows life expectancy based on the percentage of food insecurity. Figure 2E shows the results of the log rank test (which are significant as p = &lt;2e-16). Quantiles 1 and 2 (less food insecurity) observed less death than expected, but quantiles 3 and 4 (more food insecurity) observed more death than expected. This demonstrates that we are seeing a significant difference between life expectancy of people in the lower versus the higher quantiles of food insecurity.\n\n\n\nFigure 2D: As expected, those who are more food insecure have lower life expectancies.\n\n\nFigure 2E: Log Rank Test Results for Life Expectancy and Percentage of Food Insecurity\n\n\n\nQuantile\nN\nObserved\nExpected\n(O-E)^2/E\n(O-E)^2/V\n\n\n\n\nquantile=1\n704\n704\n505\n78.411\n98.013\n\n\nquantile=2\n760\n760\n584\n52.895\n68.550\n\n\nquantile=3\n757\n757\n745\n0.184\n0.254\n\n\nquantile=4\n749\n749\n1135\n131.551\n230.098\n\n\n\nKaplan-Meier Curves for life expectancy were made with the following variables: PCP Ratio, Percentage of Food Insecurity, Segregation Index, and Percentage of Broadband Internet Access. Log rank tests were performed, and all of the results were significant. To explore the curves and log rank test results, please explore our gallery below:\nGALLERY https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-lightbox-figures.html\nWe then used machine learning algorithms to predict life expectancy of individuals based on these significant covariates along with the top ten features found through KBest (see Supplemental Figure 1A). It is important to note that a lot of features were found in both the linear regression model explained above and in the KBest result.\nOur model predicted life expectancy based only on the fifteen significant access-to-care-related variables with 56% accuracy. While this may at first appear unimpressive, it’s important to note that 56% of life expectancy can be predicted or explained by only fifteen items- all of which relate to one’s access to healthcare. Only the remaining 44% can be explained by all other factors in a person’s life.\n\n\n5.3.2 Infant Mortality\n\n\n\nFigure 3A: Most states see an infant mortaliy rate of 6 deaths per 1,000 live births.\n\n\nFigure 3A shows a difference between median infant mortality rates between states. Note that the chart appears to “stair-step” as infant mortality rates are represented as integers rather than continuous numbers. Because of the linear trend associated with each state, we included the variable in our linear model to determine which states were significantly correlated with infant mortality.\n\n\n\nFigure 3B: Many of the same states that have longer life expectancies (Fig. 2B) as have lower infant mortality rates. Only Mississippi and Maryland have infant mortality rates significantly greater than the rest.\n\n\nFigure 3B shows which states were positively or negatively correlated with infant mortality. Note that this time, negative significance in plotted in green as it indicates a lower infant mortality rate. In this case, Maryland and Mississippi are the only states with significantly higher rates of infant mortality.\nIn terms of preventative healthcare measures that were significantly correlated with infant mortality (Figure 3C), we found that Median Household Income and Broadband Internet Access were significantly correlated in the negative direction with infant mortality rates. That is, as income and access to the Internet increased, infant mortality rates decreased. We came across the same issue with segregation here as we did in our life expectancy model. The Segregation Index coefficient shows that as segregation increases, infant mortality rates increase as well.\nFigure 3C: Infant Mortality Linear Model and Coefficients:\nlm(formula = `INFANT_MORTALITY_RATE` ~ `state_name` + `AVERAGE_DAILY_PM2.5` + \n    `MEDIAN_HOUSEHOLD_INCOME_LN` + `SEGREGATION_INDEX` + `%_BROADBAND_ACCESS`, \n    data = ds_mortality_adjusted)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictor\nEstimate\nStd.

Future analyses would do well to increase record-keeping of infant mortality rates by county as the metric “indicates the current health status of a population and reflects the overall state of maternal health, as well as the quality and accessibility of primary health care available to pregnant women and infants.”³\n\n\n5.3.3 Age Adjusted Death Rate\n\n\n\nFigure 4A: Most states have a median ade-adjusted mortality rate of 300-400 deaths per 100,000 people. Mississippi has both the highest median age-adjusted mortality and infant mortality rates (Fig. 3A).\n\n\nAge-adjusted death rate (mortality rate) appeared to vary across states as seen in Figure 4A, so we again kept state in our linear model. Figure 4B shows which states were significantly correlated with mortality rate. Negative correlation is in green to represent significantly lower death rates. The opposite is true for red-colored states.\n\n\n\nFigure 4B: Most states do not have an age-adjusted mortality rate different from the rest. All states with a lower mortality rate also have higher life expectancies (the same is not true for higher mortality rates and lower life expectancies).\n\n\nPreventative healthcare measures that were significantly correlated with mortality rate are shown in Figure 4C. As food insecurity, segregation, and school segregation increased, mortality rates increased as well. As broadband internet access, vaccination, and number of rural residents increased, mortality rates decreased.\nLooking at demographics, we noticed as income increased among white Americans, mortality rates decreased. This income trend was the opposite among Asian and Hispanic Americans. Looking closer at the income correlation plots, the trends for Asian and Hispanic Americans appear to have more data points that could be considered outliers. As the percentage of severe housing issues increased, the mortality rate decreased, but the correlation plot appears to have outliers that could be skewing this trend as well.\nFigure 4C: Age Adjusted Death Rate (Mortality Rate) Linear Model and Coefficients:\nlm(formula = `AGE-ADJUSTED_DEATH_RATE` ~ `state_name` + `%_VACCINATED` + \n    `%_SEVERE_HOUSING_PROBLEMS` + `%_FOOD_INSECURE` + `SCHOOL_SEGREGATION_IDX` + \n    `HOUSEHOLD_INCOME_(HISPANIC)_LN` + `SEGREGATION_INDEX` + `%_BROADBAND_ACCESS` + \n    `#_RURAL_RESIDENTS` + `HOUSEHOLD_INCOME_(WHITE)_LN` + `%_VACCINATED_(ASIAN)` + \n    `HOUSEHOLD_INCOME_(ASIAN)_LN`, data = ds_mortality_adjusted)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictor\nEstimate\nStd.

We knew that the following variables should be included in the creation of this new variable: Life Expectancy, Age-Adjusted Death Rate, Years of Potential Life Lost Rate, Percent of Frequent Physical Distress Days, and Percent of Frequent Mental Distress Days. We chose the first three for the same reasons explained in the introduction to our results.³ Note that we left out Infant Mortality Rate due to its high number of NAs, as explained above. We added the final two metrics to account for a person’s perceived quality of life, which does influence’s one’s actual health quality. A clear linear relationship is seen between each of these metrics in the pair plot below (Fig 6A).\n\n\n\nFigure 6A: We chose these five variables to summarize our overall health metric since they are all linearly correlated with each other.\n\n\nThe first eigenvalue of our entire dataset explained 31% of the variance in our dataset, so we continued by projecting the variables above to this first eigenvalue, thus “creating” a new variable that represents overall health. We then plotted the weights of all of our other variables against this new one to see how much each contributed to overall health. 87 of our original features contributed negatively to this new variable and 35 positively. Fig6B shows which features contribute the most in both a positive and negative direction to health.\n\n\n\nFigure 6B: Number of alcohol associated deaths, internet access, education level, number of dentists, and uninsured status are all variables that contribute most heavily to our overall health metric."

    "text": "3.1 Data Ingestion\nWe gathered data from two sources: KFF (an independent source for health policy research, polling, and news)⁷ and County Health Rankings and Roadmaps (CHRR).² Though we collected data across several years, we analyzed only data from 2022 due to data quality concerns when comparing year to year.\n\n3.1.1 KFF: Collection and Cleaning\nWe generated a custom report from data available on KFF, downloading a large variety of data from 2017-2022 (not including 2020 due to lack of data collection) for each state in the U.S. Variables we investigated from this dataset included percentage of population on Medicare, percentage of adults who smoke, healthcare expenditure, median annual household income, cervical cancer incidence rate, and many more potentially relevant factors.⁷\nKFF data for each state was downloaded as CSVs. We chose the most recent dates for all of the different health and insurance related questions between 2017-2022. The CSVs originally had a question, state, and value field. We used text parsing to create a column called demographic and a column called group. This allowed us to parse out demographics like age, race/ethnicity, poverty level and create groups within each of those.\nWe also created fields called year and measure, and parsed out the years and measurements from the question field. Some questions had multiple demographics, so we created a secondary_demographic field and a secondary_group field. These are not ranked.\nFinally, we added a county column (which we filled with all NA) and edited the state and question fields to replicate the way that data from our CHFF dataset was formatted. This allowed us to merge the two datasets.\n\n\n3.1.2 CHRR: Collection and Cleaning\nSimilar to KFF, we downloaded data for each state from 2017-2022 (not including 2020 due to lack of data collection) from County Health Rankings and Roadmaps (CHRR). We chose the “20xx County Health Release National Data” links for each year. Data from CHRR originally came in two separate CSVs for each year and broke up the data by each county in the United States. This data included metrics such as life_expectancy, age-adjusted_death_rate, years_of_potential_life_loss_rate, food_environment_index, percentage_of_physically_inactive_adults, percentage_of_excessive_drinking, Primary_Care_Provider_ratio, and much more.²\nFirst, we cleaned up the columns. We reviewed the documentation and renamed any potentially confusing column names. For example, #_Medicaid_Enrollees became no_female_medicaid_enrollees to avoid mistakenly believing the first column included both genders in its count. We dropped columns that would not be of help to us, such as columns containing the word Unreliable. We replaced all spaces with an underscore.\nSecond, we joined the two CSVs for each year to have one CSV per year and added a Year column to help with merging later.\nFinally, we reformatted the CSVs to match that of the KFF data, where our original columns became the question column and the values filled in a new values column. Again, we used text parsing such as grepl and gsub to fill in our newly created demographic, measure, group, secondary_demographic, and secondary_group, columns. For example, if our question was mean_%_Children_in_Poverty_(white), our demographic, group, secondary_demographic, and secondary_group columns became “Race/Ethnicity”, “White”, “Age”, and “0-17”, respectively.\nSince the questions and potential answers collected by CHRR data varied each year, we made sure that our cleaning code was modified for each year to both accommodate the changes in the data and match identical answers from previous years. As an example, the only races that were listed as options in the 2017 data were “White”, “Black”, “Hispanic”, and “Asian”. However, by the 2022 data collection, the options had expanded to include “American Indian/Alaskan Native”, “Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander”, and “Other/Multiple Races.” In 2022, “Black” was changed to “African American,” so we changed it back to “Black” to both match the earlier CHRR data and the KFF data."

    "text": "5.1 Goal 1: Predicting Chronic Conditions Based On Insurance Type\nTo answer the question of how state insurance in particular impacts one’s health status, we evaluated two common chronic conditions in the United States, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\n5.1.1 Diabetes\n\n5.1.1.1 Public Insurance\nWe immediately plotted our mean diabetes percentages by Medicaid percentage across states to see if any obvious correlation existed (see Figure 5A). No correlation was obvious, but there appeared to be a slight linear trend. We created a logisitic regression model predicting quartile of diabetes prevalence by many Medicaid-related covariates, such as how many adults did not see a doctor in the past twelve months due to cost, state Medicaid expenditure, state Medicaid spending, total Medicaid spending, and population percentage on Medicaid. Our simple model showed a surprising 54% accuracy in predicting how many people in a given population would have diabetes based on these factors. We had a small dataset, however, so cross validation showed our accuracy to be 38% with a standard deviation of 20%. While Medicaid-related factors may not be able to completely predict diabetes prevalence, it certainly is correlated.\n\n\n\nFigure 5A: There may be a slight linear correlation between mean diabetes percentage per state and Medicaid percentage, so we will see how a regression can predict diabetes prevalence.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.1.2 Private Insurance\nIn contrast, the same plot with private insurance percentages shows a negative trend (see Figure 5B).\n\n\n\nFigure 5B: Opposite of the public insurance data, there may be a slight negative linear correlation between mean diabetes percentage per state and private insurance percentage. Again, we will confirm this with regression.\n\n\nWe made another logisitic regression model with just diabetes prevalance and percent private insurance per state with only 23% accuracy. Though this is lower than the above-mentioned public insurance data, it is important to note that we are using only one predictor in this model- percent of privately insured individuals. In the above model, we used all Medicaid-related variables (thirteen total predictors). Again, this shows that a correlation exists between the type of insurance and diabetes prevalence.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)\n\n5.1.2.1 Public Insurance\nAs with our diabetes dataset, we again repeated the above process to predict CVD prevalence based on Medicaid-only related factors. Our simple scatterplot shows a faint linear trend. Our model accurately predicted CVD prevalence only 15% of the time- though this can possibly be explained by our small dataset. Cross validation testing revealed an accuracy of 41% with a standard deviation of 25%. Though not as obvious as with our diabetes data, there may be some correlation between only Medicaid-related factors and cardiovascular disease.\n\n\n\nFigure 5C: As with the diabetes data, there again appears to be a slight linear correlation between mean CVD percentage per state and Medicaid percentage.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2.2 Private Insurance\nTurning once again to our privately insured individuals, a similar model accurately prediced CVD prevalence only 15% of the time. The same problems as before apply; our dataset had few data points to truly train, and we are again only using one predictor (percent of private insurance per state) rather than thirteen from our public insurance models. The fact that our one predictor can produce an accuracy equal to the publicly insured model suggests that there may be some correlation between insurance type and chronic disease prevalence.\n\n\n\nFigure 5D: Again, there appears to be a slight negative linear correlation between mean CVD percentage per state and private insurance percentage. We will confirm this with regression."

Our goal was to determine how access to care influenced each of these three metrics for determining health of a population.\n\n5.3.1 Life Expectancy\n\n\n\nFig 2A: Median life expectancy of most states is between 77 and 80 years old.\n\n\nFigure 2A demonstrates how median life expectancy varies by state. We decided to keep state in our linear model because it did have a significant correlation with life expectancy. Since not all of the states were significantly correlated, we created the following plot to show which states were significantly correlated (positively or negatively) with life expectancy, as is seen in Figure 2B.\n\n\n\nFigure 2B: There does not appear to be a geographic influence on median life expectancy.\n\n\nFigure 2C shows our final linear model and coefficient table for preventative healthcare measures and life expectancy. We found that Primary Care Physician (PCP) Ratio were both positively correlated with life expectancy. Percentage of Food Insecurity and Segregation Index were both negatively correlated with life expectancy (that is, as food insecurity increased, life expectancy decreased). Percentage of Access to Broadband Internet was also positively correlated with life expectancy.\nFigure 2C: Life Expectancy Linear Model and Coefficient Table:\nlm(formula = `LIFE_EXPECTANCY` ~ `state_name` + `PCP_RATIO` + \n    `%_VACCINATED_(HISPANIC)` + `AVERAGE_DAILY_PM2.5` + `%_FOOD_INSECURE` + \n    `HOUSEHOLD_INCOME_(HISPANIC)_LN` +\n    `SEGREGATION_INDEX` + `%_BROADBAND_ACCESS`, data = ds_life_adjusted)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictor\nEstimate\nStd.

We then conducted a log rank test to compare across quantiles to see if the groups were significantly different from each other. Figure 2D shows life expectancy based on the percentage of food insecurity. Figure 2E shows the results of the log rank test (which are significant as p = &lt;2e-16). Quantiles 1 and 2 (less food insecurity) observed less death than expected, but quantiles 3 and 4 (more food insecurity) observed more death than expected. This demonstrates that we are seeing a significant difference between life expectancy of people in the lower versus the higher quantiles of food insecurity.\n\n\n\nFigure 2D: As expected, those who are more food insecure have lower life expectancies.\n\n\nFigure 2E: Log Rank Test Results for Life Expectancy and Percentage of Food Insecurity\n\n\n\nQuantile\nN\nObserved\nExpected\n(O-E)^2/E\n(O-E)^2/V\n\n\n\n\nquantile=1\n704\n704\n505\n78.411\n98.013\n\n\nquantile=2\n760\n760\n584\n52.895\n68.550\n\n\nquantile=3\n757\n757\n745\n0.184\n0.254\n\n\nquantile=4\n749\n749\n1135\n131.551\n230.098\n\n\n\nKaplan-Meier Curves for life expectancy were made with the following variables: PCP Ratio, Percentage of Food Insecurity, Segregation Index, and Percentage of Broadband Internet Access. Log rank tests were performed, and all of the results were significant. To explore the curves and log rank test results, please explore our gallery below:\nGALLERY https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-lightbox-figures.html\nWe then used machine learning algorithms to predict life expectancy of individuals based on these significant covariates along with the top ten features found through KBest (see Supplemental Figure 1A). It is important to note that a lot of features were found in both the linear regression model explained above and in the KBest result.\nOur model predicted life expectancy based only on the fifteen significant access-to-care-related variables with 56% accuracy. While this may at first appear unimpressive, it’s important to note that 56% of life expectancy can be predicted or explained by only fifteen items- all of which relate to one’s access to healthcare. Only the remaining 44% can be explained by all other factors in a person’s life.\n\n\n5.3.2 Infant Mortality\n\n\n\nFigure 3A: Most states see an infant mortaliy rate of 6 deaths per 1,000 live births.\n\n\nFigure 3A shows a difference between median infant mortality rates between states. Note that the chart appears to “stair-step” as infant mortality rates are represented as integers rather than continuous numbers. Because of the linear trend associated with each state, we included the variable in our linear model to determine which states were significantly correlated with infant mortality.\n\n\n\nFigure 3B: Many of the same states that have longer life expectancies (Fig. 2B) as have lower infant mortality rates. Only Mississippi and Maryland have infant mortality rates significantly greater than the rest.\n\n\nFigure 3B shows which states were positively or negatively correlated with infant mortality. Note that this time, negative significance in plotted in green as it indicates a lower infant mortality rate. In this case, Maryland and Mississippi are the only states with significantly higher rates of infant mortality.\nIn terms of preventative healthcare measures that were significantly correlated with infant mortality (Figure 3C), we found that Median Household Income and Broadband Internet Access were significantly correlated in the negative direction with infant mortality rates. That is, as income and access to the Internet increased, infant mortality rates decreased. We came across the same issue with segregation here as we did in our life expectancy model. The Segregation Index coefficient shows that as segregation increases, infant mortality rates increase as well.\nFigure 3C: Infant Mortality Linear Model and Coefficients:\nlm(formula = `INFANT_MORTALITY_RATE` ~ `state_name` + `AVERAGE_DAILY_PM2.5` + \n    `MEDIAN_HOUSEHOLD_INCOME_LN` + `SEGREGATION_INDEX` + `%_BROADBAND_ACCESS`, \n    data = ds_mortality_adjusted)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictor\nEstimate\nStd.

Future analyses would do well to increase record-keeping of infant mortality rates by county as the metric “indicates the current health status of a population and reflects the overall state of maternal health, as well as the quality and accessibility of primary health care available to pregnant women and infants.”³\n\n\n5.3.3 Age Adjusted Death Rate\n\n\n\nFigure 4A: Most states have a median ade-adjusted mortality rate of 300-400 deaths per 100,000 people. Mississippi has both the highest median age-adjusted mortality and infant mortality rates (Fig. 3A).\n\n\nAge-adjusted death rate (mortality rate) appeared to vary across states as seen in Figure 4A, so we again kept state in our linear model. Figure 4B shows which states were significantly correlated with mortality rate. Negative correlation is in green to represent significantly lower death rates. The opposite is true for red-colored states.\n\n\n\nFigure 4B: Most states do not have an age-adjusted mortality rate different from the rest. All states with a lower mortality rate also have higher life expectancies (the same is not true for higher mortality rates and lower life expectancies).\n\n\nPreventative healthcare measures that were significantly correlated with mortality rate are shown in Figure 4C. As food insecurity, segregation, and school segregation increased, mortality rates increased as well. As broadband internet access, vaccination, and number of rural residents increased, mortality rates decreased.\nLooking at demographics, we noticed as income increased among white Americans, mortality rates decreased. This income trend was the opposite among Asian and Hispanic Americans. Looking closer at the income correlation plots, the trends for Asian and Hispanic Americans appear to have more data points that could be considered outliers. As the percentage of severe housing issues increased, the mortality rate decreased, but the correlation plot appears to have outliers that could be skewing this trend as well.\nFigure 4C: Age Adjusted Death Rate (Mortality Rate) Linear Model and Coefficients:\nlm(formula = `AGE-ADJUSTED_DEATH_RATE` ~ `state_name` + `%_VACCINATED` + \n    `%_SEVERE_HOUSING_PROBLEMS` + `%_FOOD_INSECURE` + `SCHOOL_SEGREGATION_IDX` + \n    `HOUSEHOLD_INCOME_(HISPANIC)_LN` + `SEGREGATION_INDEX` + `%_BROADBAND_ACCESS` + \n    `#_RURAL_RESIDENTS` + `HOUSEHOLD_INCOME_(WHITE)_LN` + `%_VACCINATED_(ASIAN)` + \n    `HOUSEHOLD_INCOME_(ASIAN)_LN`, data = ds_mortality_adjusted)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictor\nEstimate\nStd.

Our model accurately predicted the binned death rate for 62% of our test data. Just thirteen access-to-care-related covariates predicted mortality rate 62% of the time! This again emphasizes the importance of access to care in one’s overall health status."

    "text": "5.4 Goal 4: Creating an Overall Health Quality Variable\nAs a final metric for assessing quality of health, we wanted to create a new variable that represented the overall health of a population. We knew that the following variables should be included in the creation of this new variable: Life Expectancy, Age-Adjusted Death Rate, Years of Potential Life Lost Rate, Percent of Frequent Physical Distress Days, and Percent of Frequent Mental Distress Days. We chose the first three for the same reasons explained in the introduction to our results.³ Note that we left out Infant Mortality Rate due to its high number of NAs, as explained above. We added the final two metrics to account for a person’s perceived quality of life, which does influence’s one’s actual health quality. A clear linear relationship is seen between each of these metrics in the pair plot below (Fig 6A).\n\n\n\nFigure 6A: We chose these five variables to summarize our overall health metric since they are all linearly correlated with each other.\n\n\nThe first eigenvalue of our entire dataset explained 31% of the variance in our dataset, so we continued by projecting the variables above to this first eigenvalue, thus “creating” a new variable that represents overall health. We then plotted the weights of all of our other variables against this new one to see how much each contributed to overall health. 87 of our original features contributed negatively to this new variable and 35 positively. Fig6B shows which features contribute the most in both a positive and negative direction to health.\n\n\n\nFigure 6B: Number of alcohol associated deaths, internet access, education level, number of dentists, and uninsured status are all variables that contribute most heavily to our overall health metric."
