# Background
The impact of health insurance on medical care and the health of populations is important because it could pose a solution to the growing problem of increasingly poor health across the globe. While life expectancy has increased, the amount of years spent in poor health has also increased proportionally.¹

In the United States, both private and social healthcare exist, but social healthcare is not available to everyone. Social healthcare in the US is available to those who are disabled or over 65 years old through Medicare. Medicare is not always free, but generally more affordable than private health insurance. Low income Americans can also receive free social healthcare through Medicaid. Social healthcare is funded through both federal and state health expenditures. 

While access to life-saving healthcare is crucial, preventative healthcare is generally accepted as one of the most important factors in maintaining health.⁵ Daily exercise, access to healthy foods, minimal consumption of alcohol, and access to PCPs are all important factors for improving and maintaining one’s health. 

Recent research proposes there is a direct link between health insurance type and the health quality of individuals, where countries with universal public health insurance are healthier.⁴ However, research focusing on just the United States found a positive correlation between Medicare spending and disease rate.⁸ This could simply be a “chicken and the egg” debate, where a higher disease burden exists first, leading to higher spending in those same states, or the opposite could be true. We intend to investigate this relationship by discovering how effective social healthcare is and understanding how access to preventative care correlates with health status for the lower-income populations in the US. We will do this by examining the health status of a population by commonly used markers such as life expectancy, quality of life, and mortality rates.³

We hypothesize the above-mentioned world-wide trend might be different in the United States because private health insurance is more common and those most in need are on public health insurance. 
    Although spending did not correlate meaningfully with health, certain features of the [United States’] health care system did correlate highly with health outcomes, notably rates of health insurance coverage and access to affordable care (not having to forego care due to cost)... [H]ealth outcomes were better in states with adequate primary care services to manage chronic diseases and prevent hospitalizations for conditions like heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia.⁸
Since we can expect access to preventative care to be limited for those on public health insurance in the United States and know preventative care improves health outcomes, we hypothesize that reduced access to preventative care for those on public health insurance explains the apparent paradox mentioned above.
