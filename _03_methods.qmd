# Methods
## Sources
We gathered data from two public sources: KFF (an independent source for health policy research, polling, and news)⁶ and County Health Rankings and Roadmaps (CHRR).² Data was downloaded as CSVs and then cleaned using R. A detailed description of our data cleaning along with our data organizational structure (Entity Relationship Diagram) are in the data section below.

## Data Analysis
### Statistical Thinking
We used statistics (such as Pearson's R correlation) and modeling (regression) to determine how access to preventative care correlates with health status. We determined health status using commonly used markers (proxies) such as life expectancy, quality of life, and mortality rates.³ We compared proportions across states to account for differences in population.

### Data Visualization
We used data visualization as part of both our exploratory data analysis and in our final outcome. We created a map of the United States to determine if there is a spatial relationship between our variables and quality of health. 

### Data Engineering
We stored our data into a relational database and accessed it with Postgresql (through Railway). A detailed description for how this was done is in the data section below. 

### Machine Learning
We created a simple application where the user can enter their health insurance status, demographics, and current health status to discover their predicted life expectancy and health outcomes (using common metrics such as HALY, DALY, and QALY).⁷

### Data Ethics
We were wary of furthering the gap between classes, races, and/or genders. Often, those in lower socioeconomic status tend to have lower quality of health and less access to affordable healthcare. Our goal was not to perpetuate this gap but to find potential solutions for these underserved populations. We also recognized that our datasets were incomplete and that we were not be able to represent everyone’s needs. Those who are not using well-known forms of insurance, such as Direct Primary Care, or who are not seeking traditional medical care are not represented.
