# Methods
## Data Ingestion
We gathered data from two sources: KFF (an independent source for health policy research, polling, and news)⁶ and County Health Rankings and Roadmaps (CHRR).²

### KFF: Collection and Cleaning
We generated a custom report from data available on KFF, downloading a large variety of data from 2022-2017 (not including 2020) for each state in the US. Variables we will investigate from this dataset include percentage of population on Medicare, percentage of adults who smoke, healthcare expenditure, median annual household income, cervical cancer incidence rate, and many more potentially relevant factors.⁶

KFF data for each state was downloaded as CSVs. We chose the most recent dates for all of the different health and insurance related questions, from between 2017-2022. The CSVs originally had a question, state, and value field. We used text parsing to create a column called demographic and a column called group. This allowed us to parse out demographics like age, race/ethnicity, poverty level and create groups within each of those. 
                
We also created fields called "year" and "measure", and parsed out the years and measurements from the question field. Some questions had multiple demographics, so we created a secondary demographic field and a secondary group field. These are not ranked. 

Finally, we edited the state and question fields to replicate the way that data from our CHFF dataset was formatted. This allowed us to merge the two datasets.

### CHRR: Collection and Cleaning
Similar to KFF, we downloaded data for each state from 2022-2017 (not including 2020) from CHRR. We chose the “20xx County Health Release National Data” links for each year. This data included metrics such as life expectancy, death rate, years of potential loss rate, food environment index, percentage of physically inactive adults, percentage of excessive drinking, PCP ratio, and much more.²

County Health Rankings and Roadmaps (CHRR) data was downloaded from the years 2017-2022 (excluding the missing 2020 year). Data from CHRR originally came in two separate CSVs for each year and broke up the data by each county in the United States. 

First, we cleaned up the columns. We reviewed the documentation and renamed any potentially confusing column names. For example, "#_Medicare_Enrollees" became "no_female_medicare_enrollees" to avoid mistakenly believeing the first column included both genders in its count. We dropped columns that would not be of help to us, such as the "95% CI - Low" and "95% CI - High" columns, as our dataset did not describe how these confidence intervals were found. We replaced all spaces with an underscore.

Second, we joined the two CSVs for each year to have one CSV per year and added a "Year" column to help with merging later.

Finally, we reformatted the CSVs to match that of the KFF data, where our original columns became the "question" column and the values filled in a new "values" column. Again, we used text parsing such as "grepl" and "gsub" to fill in our newly created "demographic," "measure", "group", "secondary_demographic", and "secondary_group" columns. For example, if our question was "mean_%_Children_in_Poverty_(white)", our "demographic", "group", "secondary_demographic", and "secondary_group" columns became "Race/Ethnicity", "White", "Age", and "0-17", respectively.

Since the questions and potential answers collected by CHRR data varied each year, we made sure that our cleaning code was modified for each year to both accomodate the changes in the data and match identical answers from previous years. As an example, the only races that were listed as options in the 2017 data were "White", "Black", "Hispanic", and "Asian". However, by the 2022 data collection, the options had expanded to include "American Indian/Alaskan Native", "Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander", and "Other/Multiple Races." In 2022, "Black" was changed to "African American," so we changed it back to "Black" to both match the earlier CHRR data and the KFF data.

## Data Organization
Data was combined and normalized to third normal form. The id's were primary keys for each table except for compiled_table, where "state_id," "year_id," and "question_id" were used as a compound primary key. We used the same foreign key for "group" and "secondary_group" and another separate foreign key for both "type" and "secondary_type." All columns had a NOT NULL constraint except for unit_type from the unit table, and unit_id, secondary_group_id, and secondary_type_id from compiled_table.

## Data Analysis
### Statistical Thinking
We used statistics (such as Pearson's R correlation) and modeling (regression) to determine how access to preventative care correlates with health status. We determined health status using commonly used markers (proxies) such as life expectancy, quality of life, and mortality rates.³ We compared proportions across states to account for differences in population.

### Data Visualization
We used data visualization as part of both our exploratory data analysis and in our final outcome. We created a map of the United States to determine if there is a spatial relationship between our variables and quality of health. 

### Data Engineering
We stored our data into a relational database and accessed it with Postgresql. See above for a detailed description for how this was done.

### Machine Learning
We created a simple application where the user can enter their health insurance status, demographics, and current health status to discover their predicted life expectancy and health outcomes (using common metrics such as HALY, DALY, and QALY).⁷

### Data Ethics
We were wary of furthering the gap between classes, races, and/or genders. Often, those in lower socioeconomic status tend to have lower quality of health and less access to affordable healthcare. Our goal was not to perpetuate this gap but to find potential solutions for these underserved populations. We also recognized that our datasets were incomplete and that we were not be able to represent everyone’s needs. Those who are not using well-known forms of insurance, such as Direct Primary Care, or who are not seeking traditional medical care are not represented.
