# Introduction
To answer questions regarding the effectiveness of preventative care, we investigated current relationships between health care, access to care, insurance type, and overall health outcomes across the United States. To do so, we took a multi-layered approach to our data:

1. Compare how access to care impacts common health metrics such as life expectancy, mortality, and infant mortality.Â³
2. Investigate predictability of chronic condition prevalence between public and private insurances.
3. Engineer a variable that encapsulates all health metrics to discover what factors are most important to health overall. 

By examining these questions, we aimed to contribute to the understanding of how preventative care can improve public health in the United States.
