# Introduction
To help answer questions regarding the effectiveness of preventative care, we investigated current relationships between health care, access to care, public health insurance, and overall health outcomes across the United States. We explored how primary care and prevenatitive measures impact standard health metrics, such as life expectancy, mortality, and infant mortality. We compared these metrics across demographics and insurance models (public versus private). By examining these factors, we aimed to contribute to the understanding of how preventative care can help improve public health in the United States.
